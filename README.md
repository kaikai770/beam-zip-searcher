This script quickly locates specific keywords such as ;
like part names, slotType values,and other identifiers
Both unpacked folders and zipped archives used by BeamNG.drive are suupported.
It shows you exactly where and how those terms appear.

**1 How It Works**
- Keyword Input
- You enter one or more search terms (e.g., etk_engine_i6_diesel_tuned, etk_exhaust_v8_4.4_petrol).
- Multiple terms can be searched at once, separated by commas.
- Output will highlight each keyword in a bold color so it stands out in context.

**2 Target Locations**
- You select one or more folders to scan, which can include:
- Game content (content\vehicles\)
- Installed mods (zipped or unpacked in mods\)
- External backups or work directories
- The script can scan multiple paths in a single run.

**3 Intelligent Scanning**
- Zipped mods: The script opens .zip files and checks every .jbeam inside.
- Unpacked mods: Reads .jbeam files directly.
- Recursive: It digs into every subfolder so nothing is missed.

**4. Match Reporting (with Highlighting)**
For each hit, you get:
- Keyword found (highlighted in color)
- Full file path (including zip details)
- Line number
- The exact line containing the match, with highlighted keyword for instant spotting

**üìà Use cases :**
- Modding: Pinpoint where a part is defined so you can edit or expand it.
- Debugging: Instantly see why a part isn‚Äôt attaching ‚Äî highlighted slotType values save time.
- Research: Map out content dependencies without getting lost in giant text dumps.
- Locating missing or ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù slot definitions.
- Reverse‚Äëengineering compatible parts for custom builds.
- Cleaning up old mods by tracking down unused part definitions.
